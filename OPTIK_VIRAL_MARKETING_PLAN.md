# PHASE 1: PRE-LAUNCH CONTENT STRATEGY (Weeks -3 to -1)

## Week -3: Problem Amplification + Credibility Building

### Twitter/X Thread Series

#### Thread 1: "The $50K dApp Scam" (Monday)
**Hook:** "Solana dev agencies are charging $50K for what AI can build in 5 minutes. Here's the math that'll make you angry:"

**Thread Body:**
```
1/ Solana dev agencies are charging $50K for what AI can build in 5 minutes.

Here's the math that'll make you angry:

2/ Traditional agency quote for a token launch:
• Smart contract: $8K (2 weeks)
• Frontend: $15K (3 weeks)
• Security audit: $12K (1 week)
• Tokenomics dashboard: $15K (2 weeks)

Total: $50K + 8 weeks of waiting

3/ What you're ACTUALLY getting:
- Boilerplate SPL token contract (same for everyone)
- React template with your colors swapped
- "Security audit" = running a free scanner
- Dashboard = Copy-paste ChartJS integration

4/ The dirty secret?

These agencies use the SAME templates for every client.

They're just ctrl+F replacing "TokenA" with "YourToken" and charging 500x markup.

5/ Why this exists:

Information asymmetry.

Most founders don't know Solidity/Rust. They assume complexity = value.

Agencies exploit this gap.

6/ The paradigm shift:

AI models (GPT-4/Claude) are now trained on millions of smart contract patterns.

They can generate production-ready code that's MORE consistent and secure than overworked agency devs copying Stack Overflow.

7/ This is what we built at OPTIK.

Same quality output. 1/100th the time. 1/50th the cost.

Not a template. Not a code generator.

A full AI factory that understands Solana architecture, security patterns, and tokenomics.

8/ "But isn't AI-generated code unsafe?"

We thought so too. That's why every generation runs through:
✓ Automated vulnerability scanning
✓ Compliance risk scoring
✓ Manual review for high-risk features
✓ On-chain verification

Safer than most agency code.

9/ The future isn't $50K for boilerplate.

It's $149 for custom, audited, production-ready dApps in 5 minutes.

OPTIK launches in 3 weeks.

First 100 on the waitlist get 20% off any tier.

Link in bio. 🔗

10/ If you're a dev agency reading this:

This isn't personal. You're talented.

But charging 50x for template work was never sustainable.

Pivot to high-value consulting. Let AI handle the commodity code.

The market has spoken. 🤝
```

**Viral Mechanics:**
- Contrarian stance (challenges industry pricing)
- Specific numbers (creates credibility)
- Pain point amplification (frustration sharing)
- Clear villain (overpriced agencies)
- Solution tease (OPTIK reveal)

**Engagement Tactics:**
- Pin this thread to profile
- Ask in final tweet: "What's the most you've been quoted for a simple token launch? 👇"
- Quote-tweet with: "Agency owners are NOT going to like this one 😅"

---

#### Thread 2: "I Tested 12 Solana dApp Builders" (Wednesday)
**Hook:** "I spent $2,847 testing every Solana token builder on the market. Only 1 passed basic security. Here's what I found:"

**Thread Body:**
```
1/ I spent $2,847 testing every Solana token builder on the market.

Only 1 passed basic security checks.

Here's the terrifying breakdown: 🧵

2/ THE TEST:

I generated the same SPL token on 12 different platforms.

Then I hired a whitehack security firm to audit each contract.

The results? Nightmare fuel for anyone who launched this year.

3/ Platform A (won't name names):
❌ Mint authority NOT revoked
❌ Update authority modifiable
❌ No overflow protection
❌ Hardcoded admin wallet

Their pitch: "Launch in 2 clicks!"

Reality: Exit scam waiting to happen.

4/ Platform B:
❌ Used deprecated Solana libraries
❌ No slippage protection
❌ Reentrancy vulnerable
❌ Failed mainnet deployment (but charged me anyway)

2.8K Twitter followers. Active Discord. Completely broken product.

5/ Platform C through K:

Same story, different branding.

Copy-paste template factories with zero security consideration.

"Move fast and break things" doesn't work when you're holding investor money.

6/ What these platforms have in common:

• No code review process
• No risk analysis
• No compliance checks
• No human oversight
• "Ship it and pray" mentality

7/ The one exception: [REDACTED FOR NOW]

✓ Automated vulnerability scanning
✓ Manual review for high-risk features
✓ Compliance risk scoring
✓ Automatic dangerous permissions revocation
✓ On-chain verification

Built by ex-Phantom security engineers.

8/ Why does this matter?

Because YOUR reputation is on the line.

Launch with a vulnerable contract → Exploit happens → Community blames YOU.

"But I used a builder!" isn't a defense when your holders lose money.

9/ The wake-up call:

AI code generation is incredible.

But AI without security rails is a loaded gun.

You need:
- Automated scanning
- Human review layers
- Compliance frameworks
- Real accountability

10/ We're launching that platform in 3 weeks.

It's called OPTIK.

First 100 waitlist signups get the security audit report methodology + 20% launch discount.

Building in public. No BS. Security first.

Link in bio. 🔗

11/ If you launched on one of these sketchy platforms:

Don't panic.

But DO get a third-party audit.

DM me, I'll share the security firm we used (no affiliation, just don't want to see more rugs).

We're all gonna make it. But only if we build responsibly. 🛡️
```

**Viral Mechanics:**
- Investigative journalism angle
- Fear/anxiety trigger (security vulnerability)
- Authority positioning (hired security firm)
- Curiosity gap (won't name competitors)
- Value delivery (free audit methodology)

**Engagement Tactics:**
- Tweet after posting: "The responses I'm getting from Platform A's legal team 😬📧"
- Encourage quote-tweets: "If you launched on any of these, quote-tweet for a free basic security check"

#### Thread 3: "AI Agent Terminal Philosophy" (Friday)
**Hook:** "Most AI code tools give you a chatbot. We built an AI employee. Here's why that distinction will define the next wave of development:"

**Thread Body:**
```
1/ Most AI code tools give you a chatbot.

We built an AI employee.

Here's why that distinction will define the next wave of development: 🧵

2/ The chatbot paradigm:

You: "Generate a token contract"
AI: *dumps code*
You: "Now add staking"
AI: *dumps more code*
You: "Wait, this conflicts with the first part"
AI: "You're right, let me fix that"

Context lost. Errors compounding. Frustration mounting.

3/ The problem?

Stateless interactions.

Every prompt is a fresh start. The AI has no memory of your project architecture, your security requirements, or your business logic.

You're not collaborating. You're babysitting.

4/ What developers ACTUALLY need:

An AI that understands:
• Your entire codebase context
• Your security requirements
• Your compliance constraints
• Your deployment environment
• Your business logic

And maintains that context across EVERY interaction.

5/ This is what we call "AI Agent Architecture."

Not a tool. An autonomous agent with:
- Persistent project memory
- Goal-oriented behavior
- Self-correction loops
- Security guardrails
- Domain expertise (Solana/web3)

6/ In practice, this means:

Traditional: 47 prompts to build a staking dashboard
OPTIK Agent: 1 brief. It figures out the rest.

Why? Because it UNDERSTANDS what "staking dashboard" means in Solana context:
• SPL token integration
• Vault PDA architecture
• Reward calculation
• Security considerations

7/ The technical magic:

We fine-tuned base models on:
• 10K+ audited Solana contracts
• Security vulnerability databases
• Tokenomics patterns
• UI/UX best practices for web3

Then wrapped them in agentic workflows with validation loops.

8/ What this enables (Enterprise tier):

"Build me a DAO with quadratic voting and 6-month vesting"

The agent:
1. Designs token architecture
2. Generates governance contracts
3. Builds admin dashboard
4. Creates member portal
5. Runs security analysis
6. Deploys to devnet
7. Generates documentation

You approve. It executes.

9/ Why this matters:

Because the bottleneck in crypto isn't ideas.

It's EXECUTION.

How many brilliant tokenomics models died because founders couldn't find devs?

How many projects rugged because they rushed to market with bad code?

10/ The future isn't "AI-assisted development."

It's AI-as-infrastructure.

You describe business logic. AI handles implementation, security, compliance, deployment.

You focus on community, marketing, vision.

11/ OPTIK launches in 3 weeks.

Three tiers:
• Starter: AI-generated basics ($149)
• Professional: Agent-built full stack ($279)
• Enterprise: Dedicated AI employee ($599)

First 100 waitlist: 20% off + Early access to agent terminal

Link in bio. 🔗

12/ For the technical folks wondering about the architecture:

We'll be publishing a technical whitepaper week of launch.

Covers:
- Agent framework design
- Fine-tuning methodology
- Security validation loops
- On-chain verification

This isn't vaporware. It's production-ready.

/end
```

**Viral Mechanics:**
- Paradigm shift framing (chatbot vs agent)
- Technical depth (builds authority)
- Future-focused narrative (FOMO trigger)
- Clear product differentiation
- Intellectual credibility

**Engagement Tactics:**
- Follow-up tweet: "Which existing AI coding tool frustrates you most? 🤔"
- Technical diagram quote-tweet with architecture visual

## Week -2: Social Proof + Use Case Amplification

#### Thread 4: "5 Founders, 5 dApps, 24 Hours" (Tuesday)
**Hook:** "We gave 5 non-technical founders 24 hours with OPTIK beta. Here's what they built (and what this means for the Solana ecosystem):"

**Thread Body:**
```
1/ We gave 5 non-technical founders 24 hours with OPTIK beta.

Zero coding experience. Zero Solana knowledge.

Here's what they built: 🧵

2/ FOUNDER #1: Former teacher, now NFT artist

Her idea: Community token for art collectors with staking rewards

What OPTIK generated:
• $ART token (supply: 1M)
• Staking dashboard (10% APY)
• Holder-only gallery portal
• Automatic royalty distribution

Cost if hired agency: ~$35K
OPTIK cost: $279 (Pro tier)
Time: 4 minutes, 37 seconds

3/ FOUNDER #2: Solo game dev

His idea: In-game currency for indie RPG

What OPTIK generated:
• $QUEST token with burn mechanism
• Player wallet integration
• Leaderboard + rewards logic
• Admin mint controls (for quest rewards)

Previous attempt: Paid dev $8K, got non-functional code
OPTIK: $149 (Starter tier)
Time: 3 minutes, 12 seconds

4/ FOUNDER #3: DAO organizer

Her idea: Governance token for climate activism collective

What OPTIK generated:
• $EARTH governance token
• Proposal submission system
• Quadratic voting mechanism
• Treasury management dashboard
• 6-month contributor vesting

Agency quote she got: $67K + 12 weeks
OPTIK: $599 (Enterprise tier)
Time: 8 minutes, 51 seconds

5/ FOUNDER #4: Fitness influencer

His idea: Token-gated workout app

What OPTIK generated:
• $FIT token with tiered access
• Content unlock system (Bronze/Silver/Gold holders)
• Streak rewards (workout consistency = token airdrops)
• Referral tracking

He had ZERO idea where to start before OPTIK
OPTIK: $279 (Pro tier)
Time: 5 minutes, 04 seconds

6/ FOUNDER #5: Restaurant owner

Her idea: Loyalty program on Solana (yes, really)

What OPTIK generated:
• $LOYAL token (1 token = $1 discount)
• QR code redemption system
• Customer dashboard
• Merchant admin panel
• Monthly burn of unclaimed tokens

This is the future of main street crypto adoption.
OPTIK: $279 (Pro tier)
Time: 6 minutes, 22 seconds

7/ The pattern:

None of these founders could have built this solo.

All would have paid $20K-60K to agencies (if they could even find one willing to take small projects).

Most would have given up entirely.

8/ What they said (actual quotes):

🗣️ "I thought I'd need a CTO. Turns out I just needed coffee and OPTIK."

🗣️ "The security audit alone would've cost more than this entire platform."

🗣️ "This is the Canva moment for blockchain. I can actually BUILD now."

9/ The implications:

Right now, there are 100K+ ideas for Solana dApps locked in non-technical founders' heads.

Every one is a potential:
• Community
• TVL contributor
• Ecosystem growth

OPTIK unlocks that dam.

10/ Launch dynamics:

These 5 beta testers are launching their projects week of OPTIK launch.

Real products. Real tokens. Real communities.

You'll be able to see "Built with OPTIK" in production.

No vaporware. No mockups. Actual value.

11/ OPTIK launches in 2 weeks.

Waitlist just hit 1,200 signups (🔥).

First 100 still get 20% off all tiers.

If you have an idea that's been stuck in your head because you "aren't technical enough":

Your time just came.

Link in bio. 🔗

12/ For the "but AI code is bad!" skeptics:

All 5 projects passed third-party security audits.

All 5 deployed to mainnet without issues.

All 5 founders understood their codebase well enough to make custom modifications.

The proof isn't in the promise. It's in production.

/end
```

**Viral Mechanics:**
- Story-based (human connection)
- Specific examples (credibility)
- Cost comparison (practical value trigger)
- Relatable personas (audience identification)
- Social proof (beta testimonials)

**Engagement Tactics:**
- Tag each beta tester (if they have Twitter)
- Create quote graphic for Tweet #8
- Follow-up: "Which project are you most excited to see launch? 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5?"

#### Thread 5: "The Security Trade-off Myth" (Thursday)
**Hook:** "Everyone thinks: Fast OR Secure. Pick one. We analyzed 10,000 smart contracts and found the opposite is true. Here's why speed might actually IMPROVE security:"

**Thread Body:**
```
1/ Everyone thinks: Fast OR Secure. Pick one.

We analyzed 10,000 smart contracts and found the opposite is true.

Here's why speed might actually IMPROVE security: 🧵

2/ The traditional development timeline:

Week 1-2: Dev writes contract
Week 3-4: Dev writes frontend
Week 5: Security audit finds 8 vulnerabilities
Week 6-7: Fix vulnerabilities, introduce 3 new bugs
Week 8: Re-audit
Week 9: Deploy

What can go wrong? Everything.

3/ The vulnerability sources:

• Developer fatigue (week 7 burnout)
• Inconsistent coding standards
• Copy-paste errors from Stack Overflow
• Outdated libraries
• Miscommunication between frontend/backend devs
• "Ship it" pressure as deadline approaches

4/ The paradox:

MORE time = MORE human error opportunities.

Each iteration is a chance for someone to:
- Forget to update a dependent function
- Introduce a race condition
- Miss an edge case
- Use a deprecated method

5/ Now consider AI generation:

• Zero fatigue
• 100% consistent patterns
• No copy-paste errors (generates from scratch)
• Always uses latest Solana standards
• No communication gaps (single context)
• No deadline pressure compromises

6/ Our data:

We compared 147 human-written vs 147 OPTIK-generated contracts.

Vulnerabilities found in third-party audits:
• Human contracts: avg 4.7 vulnerabilities
• OPTIK contracts: avg 0.9 vulnerabilities

Why?

7/ Reason 1: Pattern recognition

AI models trained on millions of contracts KNOW what vulnerable code looks like.

Humans might have seen 50-100 contracts.
GPT-4 has internalized patterns from 10M+ codebases.

It "sees" vulnerabilities we miss.

8/ Reason 2: No creativity in the bad way

Human devs get creative: "I'll optimize this with a clever trick!"

That "trick" is often a security hole.

AI sticks to battle-tested patterns. Boring = Secure.

9/ Reason 3: Automated validation loops

Every OPTIK generation runs through:
1. Syntax validation
2. Logic flow analysis
3. Known vulnerability pattern matching
4. Solana best practice verification
5. Edge case simulation
6. On-chain simulation

This happens in 30 seconds. Every. Single. Time.

Human QA? Maybe if you're lucky.

10/ Reason 4: Update consistency

Solana updates its libraries constantly.

Human devs need to:
- Read changelog
- Understand implications
- Refactor code
- Test changes

AI models get retrained on latest patterns immediately.

Your OPTIK dApp is always using current best practices.

11/ The counter-argument:

"But AI can't think creatively about complex attack vectors!"

TRUE. That's why we have HUMAN security review for high-risk features.

The combo is: AI for consistency + Humans for edge cases = Best of both worlds.

12/ What this means practically:

An OPTIK-generated dApp is:
• Faster to market (minutes vs months)
• More secure (fewer vulnerabilities)
• More maintainable (consistent patterns)
• More reliable (automated testing)

This isn't trade-off. It's upgrade.

13/ OPTIK launches in 2 weeks.

Every tier includes:
✓ Automated security analysis
✓ Vulnerability scanning
✓ Compliance risk scoring
✓ On-chain verification

Enterprise tier adds:
✓ Manual security review
✓ Penetration testing report
✓ Ongoing monitoring

Link in bio. 🔗

14/ If you're a security researcher:

We want you to TRY to break OPTIK-generated contracts.

Launch week: $5K bounty for any critical vulnerability found in our output.

Put your money where your skepticism is. 🛡️

/end
```

**Viral Mechanics:**
- Counter-intuitive thesis (speed improves security)
- Data-driven (10K contract analysis)
- Fear mitigation (addresses security concerns)
- Authority building (detailed technical knowledge)
- Challenge/bounty (engagement + credibility)

**Engagement Tactics:**
- Pin bounty announcement
- Quote-tweet with: "Security researchers: Come at us. $5K says you can't break our output. 💪"
- Encourage debate: "Devs: Am I wrong here? What am I missing?"

## Week -1: FOMO Building + Waitlist Push

#### Thread 6: "The 3 AM Decision" (Monday)
**Hook:** "I almost didn't build OPTIK. At 3 AM, staring at 10,000 lines of code, I had a realization that changed everything:"

**Thread Body:**
```
1/ I almost didn't build OPTIK.

At 3 AM, staring at 10,000 lines of code, I had a realization that changed everything: 🧵

2/ CONTEXT:

Two years ago, I was the dev agencies charged $50K.

I'd spend weeks building SPL tokens, staking dashboards, governance systems.

Same patterns. Different clients. Good money.

3/ Then a founder asked me:

"Why does this take 6 weeks? Isn't it basically the same as the last project you showed me?"

I gave the professional answer: "Each project has unique requirements, security considerations, custom architecture..."

The real answer? He was right.

4/ That night, I couldn't sleep.

I audited my own work:

Project A: 10,247 lines
Project B: 10,583 lines
Project C: 9,891 lines

I diff'd the files.

78% identical code. Copy-pasted. Find-and-replaced. "Custom development."

I was a human template engine.

5/ The uncomfortable truth:

I was charging $40K for 2,200 lines of actual new code.

The rest? Boilerplate I'd written once and reused forever.

But I NEEDED 6 weeks because:
- Client revisions
- Integration testing
- Security review
- My own context-switching between projects

6/ The 3 AM question:

"What if I could eliminate MY job?"

Not because I hated it.

But because 100 founders were on waitlists for every 1 I could help.

The bottleneck was ME. My time. My hands on keyboard.

7/ I started experimenting with GPT-3 (this was early):

First attempt: Generate a token contract.

Result: Garbage. Syntax errors. Deprecated functions.

I laughed it off. "AI will never replace this."

8/ But I kept trying.

GPT-3.5 → Better but still broken.
GPT-4 → Holy shit, this actually compiles.
GPT-4 + custom prompting → Wait, this is better than my boilerplate.
GPT-4 + fine-tuning + validation loops → This is better than MOST devs.

9/ The breakthrough moment:

I generated a staking contract with GPT-4.

Ran it through the SAME security audit firm I used for client work.

Result: 0 critical vulnerabilities, 1 minor optimization suggestion.

Better than code I'd written by hand the week before.

10/ The decision:

Option A: Keep charging $50K per project, help 20 founders per year.

Option B: Build a system that could help 1,000 founders per year at 1/50th the cost.

Option A was better for my bank account.

Option B was better for the ecosystem.

11/ I chose B.

Not out of altruism. Out of inevitability.

This WAS going to happen. Either I built it, or someone else would.

At least I could build it RIGHT:
- Security-first
- Compliance-aware
- Human oversight
- No BS marketing

12/ 18 months of building:

• Trained models on 10K+ audited contracts
• Built agentic validation loops
• Integrated security scanning
• Created manual review systems
• Tested with 147 beta users

OPTIK launches in 7 days.

13/ What we're NOT:

• A dev agency killer (you'll pivot to high-value work)
• A "get rich quick" tool (we reject scam projects)
• A replacement for technical founders (it's a force multiplier)
• Perfect (we'll have bugs, we'll iterate)

14/ What we ARE:

• The fastest path from idea → audited dApp
• A security-first alternative to sketchy builders
• A way for non-technical founders to execute
• Infrastructure for the next wave of Solana growth

15/ Launch week details:

• Monday 8 AM EST: Doors open
• First 100: 20% off all tiers (waitlist)
• First 50 generations: Featured in launch showcase
• $5K security bounty: Find a critical vulnerability

Waitlist closes in 7 days at 5,000 signups (currently: 2,847).

Link in bio. 🔗

16/ To the founder reading this at 3 AM with an idea you can't build:

Your moment is 7 days away.

To the dev reading this thinking "this kills my business":

Your skills are too valuable to waste on boilerplate. Let AI handle the commodity. You handle the complex.

We're all gonna make it. 🤝

/end
```

**Viral Mechanics:**
- Personal vulnerability (authentic storytelling)
- Origin story (human connection)
- Ethical framing (ecosystem over profit)
- Specific timeline (urgency trigger)
- Clear CTA (7-day countdown)

**Engagement Tactics:**
- Quote-tweet: "This was the hardest business decision I've ever made. But it was the right one."
- Pin to profile for final week
- Follow-up: "Founders: What's YOUR 3 AM realization? 👇"

13/ THE COMPETITION:

We know you have options.

Other platforms are cheaper. Some are "free."

But they're NOT:
✓ Security-audited
✓ Compliance-aware
✓ Manually reviewed (high-risk)
✓ Backed by real founders

Cheap now = expensive when you get exploited.

14/ WHO THIS ISN'T FOR:

• Scam projects (we reject + blacklist)

• Illegal securities (compliance engine flags)
• "Get rich quick" schemes (not our vibe)

We're building infrastructure, not enabling fraud.

15/ WHO THIS IS FOR:

• Non-technical founders with real ideas
• Developers who want to ship 10x faster
• Agencies that need white-label solutions
• DAOs that want governance infrastructure
• Communities launching tokens the RIGHT way

16/ 48 HOURS.

This is 2 years of building.
147 beta testers.
10,000+ contracts analyzed.
$180K in development costs.
Countless 3 AM debugging sessions.

We're ready. The question is: Are you?

## Reddit Strategy (Pre-Launch)

### r/solana Post (Week -2)

**Title:** "I analyzed 147 Solana token launches to find the real cost of bringing a dApp to market. The results surprised me."

**Post Body:**
```
I've been building on Solana for 2 years as a dev-for-hire. Last month, I decided to actually track what founders are REALLY spending to go from idea to mainnet launch.

Surveyed 147 founders across Solana Discord, Twitter, and direct outreach.

Here's the breakdown:

**AGENCY ROUTE (43 founders):**
- Average cost: $47,300
- Average timeline: 9.2 weeks
- Success rate: 58% (18 never launched due to cost/delays)
- Satisfaction: 6.2/10

**FREELANCE DEV ROUTE (67 founders):**
- Average cost: $18,500
- Average timeline: 11.7 weeks
- Success rate: 52% (dev ghosted or delivered broken code)
- Satisfaction: 5.8/10

**DIY / LEARN TO CODE ROUTE (37 founders):**
- Average cost: $3,200 (courses, tools, failed deploys)
- Average timeline: 24+ weeks (many never finished)
- Success rate: 27%
- Satisfaction: 7.1/10 (those who succeeded LOVED it)

**The patterns I noticed:**

1. **Agencies prioritize big clients.** If you're not doing $100K+ projects, you're bottom of the queue. Expect delays.

2. **Freelance devs are hit-or-miss.** Amazing 20% of the time. Disaster 40% of the time. "Meh" 40% of the time.

3. **DIY is viable IF you have 6+ months.** Most founders don't. Market timing matters in crypto.

4. **Security audits are the hidden cost.** Median: $12K. Range: $5K-$50K. Many founders skip it (yikes).

5. **Revisions kill timelines.** Original quote: 4 weeks. Actual delivery: 12 weeks. Because "one small change" cascades.

**What founders actually said (anonymized):**

> "I paid $31K for a token and staking dashboard. Found out later 80% was copy-pasted from another project. Felt scammed but had no recourse."

> "Hired a dev from Upwork. He disappeared after 60% payment. Lost $8K and 7 weeks."

> "Went the DIY route. Took me 5 months but I OWN my code and understand every line. Worth it if you have time."

> "Agency delivered on time but the code was spaghetti. When I needed changes post-launch, they wanted another $15K. Stuck now."

**My conclusions:**

- There's a massive gap between "I have an idea" and "I have a working dApp"
- Current solutions optimize for BUILDERS, not FOUNDERS
- AI code gen tools are getting scary good, but most are security nightmares
- The Solana ecosystem needs better infrastructure for non-technical founders

**What I'm building about it:**

I've spent the last 18 months creating an AI-powered generation platform that:
- Produces audited, production-ready dApps in ~5 minutes
- Costs 1/50th of agency rates ($149-$599 depending on complexity)
- Includes automated security analysis + manual review for high-risk features
- Gives you full code ownership (MIT license)

Not shilling (mods let me know if this crosses line), but genuinely think this is what the ecosystem needs. Launching in 2 weeks. Happy to answer questions about the research or the tech.

**Questions for the community:**

1. If you've launched a token/dApp, what was your experience?
2. What's the biggest barrier you faced (or are facing)?
3. Would AI code generation worry you from a security standpoint?

Want to make sure I'm actually solving real problems, not just building in a vacuum.
```

**Viral Mechanics:**
- Data-driven (147 founders surveyed)
- Value-first (research insights before pitch)
- Community-oriented (asks for feedback)
- Transparent (acknowledges potential mod concerns)

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Respond to EVERY comment within 2 hours
- Provide additional data points when asked
- Share security methodology when questioned
- DO NOT be overly promotional in responses

### r/CryptoCurrency Post (Week -1)

**Title:** "The 'AI will rug you' narrative is backwards. Here's why AI-generated smart contracts might actually be MORE secure than human-written code."

**Post Body:**
```
Unpopular opinion incoming. Prepare your downvotes.

I keep seeing comments like "AI code? That's how you get exploited" or "Never trust AI-generated contracts."

I think this is fundamentally misunderstanding where vulnerabilities come from.

**Where exploits ACTUALLY come from:**

I analyzed 1,247 hacks/exploits in crypto (2020-2025) and categorized root causes:

- **Logic errors (38%)**: Dev misunderstood economics/game theory
  - Example: Assumed users would act rationally (they don't)

- **Copy-paste mistakes (27%)**: Dev copied Stack Overflow code without understanding it
  - Example: Pasted ERC20 function into SPL token (different architecture)

- **Fatigue/rushing (18%)**: Dev was overworked, missed edge case
  - Example: "Ship it Friday" pressure → forgot to revoke mint authority

- **Outdated libraries (12%)**: Dev used deprecated functions with known vulnerabilities
  - Example: Used Anchor 0.24 code patterns in 0.29 (breaking changes)

- **Communication gaps (5%)**: Frontend and backend devs misaligned
  - Example: Frontend assumed backend validated inputs (it didn't)

**Notice what's NOT on this list?**

"Developer was too consistent."
"Developer followed best practices too strictly."
"Developer never got tired."

Those are literally impossible for humans. They're AI's STRENGTHS.

**The AI advantage:**

1. **Pattern recognition**: GPT-4 was trained on millions of contracts. It "knows" what vulnerable code looks like because it's seen every variation. Human devs have seen maybe 100 contracts.

2. **Zero copy-paste errors**: AI generates from first principles. It's not copying Stack Overflow answers it doesn't understand.

3. **Never fatigued**: Doesn't make mistakes at 11 PM on a Friday. Same quality at generation 1 and generation 1,000.

4. **Always current**: Models get retrained on latest patterns. Your human dev needs to manually read Solana changelogs and refactor.

5. **Consistent architecture**: No communication gaps. Single model = single source of truth.

**The AI disadvantage:**

AI CAN'T think creatively about novel attack vectors.

If there's a never-before-seen exploit pattern, AI won't catch it (because it wasn't in training data).

**The solution:**

AI for consistency + Humans for edge cases = Best of both worlds.

This is what modern software looks like:
- AI writes boilerplate (fast, consistent, secure)
- Humans review for business logic and novel risks
- Automated tools scan for known vulnerabilities
- On-chain simulation catches deployment issues

**My bias:**

Full disclosure: I'm building an AI dApp generation platform (OPTIK, launches next week).

So yes, I'm biased.

BUT, I also hired a third-party security firm to audit 147 contracts:
- 73 human-written (from various devs)
- 74 AI-generated (from our system)

Results:
- Human: avg 4.7 vulnerabilities per contract
- AI: avg 0.9 vulnerabilities per contract

The firm's conclusion: "AI output was more consistent and had fewer critical flaws. Human code had more creativity but also more mistakes."

**What this means:**

I'm NOT saying fire all developers.

I'm saying:
1. AI is better at commodity code (tokens, staking, standard patterns)
2. Humans are better at complex, novel systems (new DeFi primitives, advanced game theory)
3. The combo is stronger than either alone

**Your move:**

Downvote me because "AI bad" or engage with the actual data.

I'd genuinely love to hear counterarguments. What am I missing?

(Mods: If this is too promotional, I can edit. Trying to start a real discussion.)
```

**Viral Mechanics:**
- Contrarian thesis (AI > humans for security)
- Data-driven (1,247 exploits analyzed)
- Intellectual honesty (acknowledges bias)
- Invites debate (engagement magnet)

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Engage with critical comments constructively
- Provide sources when challenged on data
- Award Reddit Gold to best counterarguments
- DO NOT be defensive

## LinkedIn Strategy (Pre-Launch)

### Post 1: Enterprise/VC Angle (Week -2)

**Hook:** "Venture-backed founders: You're wasting $50K and 8 weeks on commodity infrastructure. Here's the new playbook."

**Post Body:**
```
Venture-backed founders: You're wasting $50K and 8 weeks on commodity infrastructure. Here's the new playbook.

I've worked with 40+ crypto startups post-seed. Same pattern every time:

📅 Week 1-2: Founder realizes they need token infrastructure
📅 Week 3-4: Interview dev agencies, get $40K-$80K quotes
📅 Week 5: Hire agency, pay 50% upfront ($25K)
📅 Week 6-10: Wait while agency builds boilerplate
📅 Week 11: Get MVP, request changes
📅 Week 12-13: Revision cycle
📅 Week 14: Finally launch (now 9 weeks behind market timing)

Result: $50K spent, 3 months burned, commodity code delivered.

**The uncomfortable question:**

Why are we hiring humans to write boilerplate in 2026?

This isn't complex DeFi. It's:
- SPL token contracts (same 90% for everyone)
- Staking dashboards (identical architecture)
- Mint websites (templated)

We've been conditioned to think "custom development" = value.

Reality: We're paying $50K for Find-and-Replace.

**The paradigm shift:**

AI models (GPT-4, Claude Opus) are now trained on millions of smart contracts.

They can generate production-ready, audited code in minutes.

Not templates. Not low-code. Actual custom architecture.

Tested this with 147 generations. Third-party security audits showed AI output had 80% fewer vulnerabilities than typical agency code.

Why? Because AI doesn't:
- Get fatigued at 11 PM
- Copy-paste Stack Overflow without understanding
- Miss edge cases due to deadline pressure
- Forget to update deprecated libraries

**What this means for VCs:**

Your portfolio companies can now:
- Launch token infrastructure in days, not months
- Allocate $50K to growth instead of boilerplate
- Iterate faster (regenerate in 5 min vs 2 week revision cycles)
- Maintain security (automated audits + manual review)

**The new stack:**

AI for commodity → Humans for differentiation

Let AI handle:
✓ Token contracts
✓ Staking mechanisms
✓ Governance systems
✓ Standard dashboards

Keep humans for:
✓ Novel DeFi primitives
✓ Complex game theory
✓ Unique business logic
✓ Strategic architecture

**What I'm building:**

OPTIK: AI-powered Solana dApp factory

- $149-$599 per generation (vs $40K agencies)
- 5-15 minutes (vs 8 weeks)
- Security-audited, compliance-checked
- Full code ownership (MIT license)

Launching next week. 30+ beta testers from YC/a16z portfolio companies.

Not selling—just sharing the shift I'm seeing in how technical infrastructure gets built.

**The question for founders:**

If you could launch your token infrastructure in 10 minutes for $279 (audited, production-ready, full ownership)...

Would you still pay an agency $50K and wait 8 weeks?

That's not rhetorical. I'm genuinely asking.

Comment or DM. Building in public and want to solve real problems.

### Post 2: Technical Leadership Angle (Week -1)

**Hook:** "CTOs: Your devs shouldn't be writing SPL token contracts in 2026. Here's what they should be doing instead."

**Post Body:**
```
CTOs: Your devs shouldn't be writing SPL token contracts in 2026. Here's what they should be doing instead.

I hired my first blockchain developer in 2021. Brilliant engineer. Rust expert. $180K salary.

Watched him spend 3 weeks building a staking dashboard.

When I reviewed the code, 70% was identical to the last staking dashboard he built.

**The revelation:**

My $180K engineer was a human template engine.

Not because he was bad. Because that's what the job required.

Same patterns. Different variable names. Repeat.

**The misallocation:**

What we HIRED him for:
- Novel protocol design
- Complex security architecture
- Performance optimization
- Strategic technical decisions

What he ACTUALLY did:
- SPL token boilerplate (week 1-2)
- Standard staking contract (week 3-4)
- Mint website frontend (week 5-6)
- Security testing (week 7-8)

2 months. $30K in salary. Commodity output.

**The AI comparison:**

I tested GPT-4 on the same task:
- Generated staking dashboard: 4 minutes
- Passed same security audit: 0 critical issues
- Code quality: Equal or better (more consistent patterns)

Cost: $279 (OPTIK platform fee)

**My math:**

$30K (2 months salary) vs $279 (AI generation) = 107x efficiency gain

Even if AI required 10 hours of senior dev review = still 20x cheaper

**The strategic shift:**

Stop hiring developers to write boilerplate.

Hire them to:
1. **Design systems AI can't**: Novel protocols, advanced game theory, unique architectures
2. **Review AI output**: Security validation, edge case analysis, compliance review
3. **Optimize performance**: Where AI generates "good enough," humans make it exceptional
4. **Strategic decisions**: What to build, not how to implement standard patterns

**The new technical stack:**

Commodity layer: AI
Differentiation layer: Humans

This isn't "replace developers." It's "elevate developers."

Your Rust expert shouldn't waste talent on SPL boilerplate.

They should architect the next generation of DeFi primitives.

**What this looks like practically:**

OLD WORKFLOW:
- Junior dev: 3 weeks building token contract
- Senior dev: 1 week reviewing
- Total: 4 weeks, $12K salary cost

NEW WORKFLOW:
- AI: 5 min generating token contract
- Senior dev: 2 hours reviewing/customizing
- Total: 2 hours, $279 platform + $200 salary = $479

$12K → $479
4 weeks → 2 hours

**The objection I hear:**

"But AI can't handle our complex requirements!"

TRUE for novel systems.

FALSE for tokens, staking, governance, minting.

95% of web3 projects use standard patterns. That's the low-hanging fruit.

**What I built:**

OPTIK: AI dApp factory for Solana

Used by 30+ portfolio companies to:
- Generate commodity infrastructure instantly
- Free senior devs for high-value work
- Maintain security (automated audits + manual review)
- Accelerate time-to-market

Launching next week. Not selling—sharing the workflow shift.

**The question:**

If your devs could generate audited token infrastructure in 5 minutes...

What SHOULD they be working on instead?

Drop your answer below. Genuinely curious what problems are actually worth human attention.

## Discord/Telegram Strategy (Pre-Launch)

### Community Seeding Messages

**Message 1: Value-First Introduction (Week -3)**

```
Hey everyone! 👋

Been lurking here for a while learning from the community. Wanted to share something I've been working on that might help founders here.

**CONTEXT:**
I'm a dev who's built 40+ Solana dApps as freelance work over the past 2 years. Got tired of charging $30K for what's essentially boilerplate code, so I spent 18 months building an AI system that can generate production-ready dApps in minutes.

**WHAT IT DOES:**
- Input: Describe your token/dApp requirements
- Output: Full smart contract + frontend + security audit
- Time: 3-15 minutes depending on complexity
- Cost: $149-$599 (vs $30K-$60K for agencies)

**WHY I'M SHARING:**
Launching in 3 weeks and want to make sure I'm solving REAL problems, not just building in a vacuum.

**QUESTIONS FOR THIS COMMUNITY:**
1. What's the biggest barrier you've faced trying to launch a Solana project?
2. Would AI-generated code worry you from a security standpoint?
3. What features would actually matter to you? (vs what I THINK matters)

Not trying to shill—genuinely want feedback. Happy to answer questions about the tech, security approach, or Solana development in general.

If mods think this is too promotional, let me know and I'll edit! 🙏
```

**Message 2: Security Deep-Dive (Week -2)**

```
Following up on yesterday's convo about AI security concerns. A few of you asked how we handle this, so here's the technical breakdown:

**5-LAYER SECURITY VALIDATION:**

1️⃣ **Syntax + Logic Validation**
- Runs immediately after generation
- Catches basic errors (missing brackets, wrong types, etc.)
- Uses Rust compiler + Anchor validator

2️⃣ **Pattern Matching Against Known Vulnerabilities**
- Database of 10K+ known exploit patterns
- Checks for: reentrancy, overflow, authority issues, etc.
- Blocks generation if critical pattern detected

3️⃣ **Solana Best Practice Verification**
- Checks against official Solana security guidelines
- Validates: PDA derivation, CPI security, account ownership
- Flags non-standard patterns for human review

4️⃣ **On-Chain Simulation**
- Deploys to devnet
- Runs 50+ test scenarios
- Simulates: edge cases, attack vectors, stress tests

5️⃣ **Manual Review (High-Risk Projects)**
- Human security engineer reviews flagged generations
- Checks: complex tokenomics, novel patterns, large supplies
- Can request changes or reject entirely

**COMPARISON:**
Most dApp builders: Layer 1 only (if that)
Most freelance devs: Layers 1-3 (if you're lucky)
Top agencies: Layers 1-4
OPTIK: All 5 layers

**THE BOUNTY:**
Launching with $5K bug bounty. Find a critical vulnerability in our generated code → Get paid.

Putting money where mouth is. 💰

Questions? Concerns? Things I'm missing?

### LinkedIn Launch Post

**Hook:** "After 18 months and $180K in development, OPTIK is live. Here's what we learned building AI infrastructure for Solana."

**Post Body:**
```
After 18 months and $180K in development, OPTIK is live.

AI-powered Solana dApp factory. Production-ready code in 5 minutes. $149-$599 vs $50K agencies.

But this isn't a launch announcement. It's a post-mortem on what we learned.

**LESSON 1: AI IS GREAT AT PATTERNS, TERRIBLE AT EDGE CASES**

We trained GPT-4 on 10K+ audited smart contracts. It generates incredible boilerplate.

But when a beta tester asked for "quadratic voting with 6-month vesting," the AI confidently generated nonsense.

The fix? Hybrid approach:
- AI handles patterns (tokens, staking, standard features)
- Humans handle novelty (complex logic, unique requirements)

Our Enterprise tier has an AI Agent + human review. Best of both.

**LESSON 2: FOUNDERS DON'T WANT "AI MAGIC," THEY WANT TRANSPARENCY**

Early beta had a black box: Input requirements → Wait → Get code.

Conversion rate: 34%

We added real-time progress updates:
"Generating token contract..."
"Running security analysis..."
"Simulating on-chain deployment..."

Conversion rate: 71%

People trust what they can see.

**LESSON 3: SECURITY ISN'T A FEATURE, IT'S THE FOUNDATION**

We almost launched without manual review. "AI is good enough!"

Then a beta tester requested a token with "admin can mint unlimited supply forever."

Red flag for rug pull. AI didn't care. It generated the code.

We added:
- Compliance risk scoring
- High-risk project flagging
- Manual human review for dangerous patterns

Rejected 14 projects during beta. Probably saved thousands of people from rugs.

Worth the extra engineering cost.

**LESSON 4: PRICING IS PSYCHOLOGY, NOT MATH**

We calculated our costs: ~$12 per generation (API fees, infrastructure, support).

Priced at $49 → "This must be low quality"
Priced at $999 → "This is expensive"
Priced at $149-$599 → "This is reasonable for what I'm getting"

Same product. Different perception.

Founders don't want the cheapest. They want VALUE.

**LESSON 5: COMMUNITY > MARKETING**

We spent $0 on ads.

Instead:
- Built in public on Twitter (2,400 followers gained)
- Engaged in Solana Discord servers (800+ conversations)
- Published technical deep-dives on Reddit (40K+ views)
- Shared our security methodology openly

Result: 4,200 waitlist signups. $0 CAC.

Transparency builds trust. Trust builds community. Community builds products.

**THE LAUNCH:**

OPTIK is live today: optik.build

Three tiers ($149 / $279 / $599) depending on complexity.

Security-audited. Compliance-checked. Human-reviewed (high-risk projects).

First 100 waitlist signups get 20% off.

**WHAT'S NEXT:**

Month 1: Stabilize, fix bugs, support early adopters
Month 2: White-label solutions (agencies can resell)
Month 3: Multi-chain support (Ethereum L2s)

We're building infrastructure. Infrastructure needs to be BORING and RELIABLE.

Flashy pivots are for consumer apps. We're playing the long game.

**THE ASK:**

If you're launching a Solana project, try OPTIK. If it sucks, tell me why (DMs open).

If you're a VC, share with portfolio companies. We've saved 30+ beta companies $1.2M in dev costs.

If you're a dev, I'm NOT trying to replace you. I'm trying to free you from boilerplate so you can build novel shit.

Let's raise the bar for how we build in web3.

**HOW IT WORKS:**
1. Describe your project (name, supply, tokenomics, features)
2. Pay with SOL (direct wallet, on-chain verified)
3. Watch real-time generation progress
4. Review code + security report
5. Deploy or download

Average generation time from beta: 5 min 32 sec

**SECURITY APPROACH:**
(Since this was the biggest concern in previous threads)

Every generation goes through:
✓ Automated vulnerability scanning
✓ Known exploit pattern matching
✓ Solana best practice verification
✓ On-chain simulation (devnet testing)
✓ Compliance risk assessment

Enterprise tier adds:
✓ Human security engineer review
✓ Manual penetration testing

We also have a $5K bug bounty for anyone who finds critical vulnerabilities in generated code.

**BETA RESULTS:**
- 147 testers
- 89 projects generated
- 47 deployed to mainnet (so far)
- 0 critical security issues found in third-party audits
- Avg satisfaction: 8.7/10

**LAUNCH WEEK SPECIAL:**
First 100 people: 20% off (code: SOLANA20)
Valid until [DATE]

**TRANSPARENCY:**
- Bootstrapped (no VC funding)
- $180K dev investment over 18 months
- Open to feedback and iteration
- We reject scam/rug projects (manual review catches this)

**MY ASK:**

If you try it and it sucks, PLEASE tell me why. DMs open.

If you have concerns about AI-generated code security, check our methodology: optik.build/security

If you have questions about Solana development in general, happy to help in comments.

**Title:** "AI Code Generation for Smart Contracts Is Here (And It Might Be More Secure Than Human Devs)"

**Post:**
```
Launched OPTIK today: AI-powered system that generates production-ready Solana dApps in ~5 minutes.

After 18 months of building and 147 beta testers, here's what we learned about AI vs humans for smart contract development.

**THE HYPOTHESIS:**

AI-generated code would be LESS secure than human-written code.

**THE TEST:**

Hired third-party security firm to audit:
- 73 human-written contracts (from various devs/agencies)
- 74 OPTIK-generated contracts

Blind study. Auditors didn't know which was which.

**THE RESULTS:**

Human contracts:
- Avg vulnerabilities: 4.7 per contract
- Critical issues: 18% had at least one
- Most common: Logic errors, copy-paste mistakes, outdated libraries

AI contracts:
- Avg vulnerabilities: 0.9 per contract
- Critical issues: 3% had at least one
- Most common: Edge cases in novel patterns (expected)

**WHY AI DID BETTER:**

1. **Consistency**: No fatigue, no rushing, no "Friday 5 PM ship it" mistakes
2. **Pattern recognition**: Trained on millions of contracts, "knows" vulnerable patterns
3. **No copy-paste errors**: Generates from scratch, doesn't copy Stack Overflow blindly
4. **Always current**: Uses latest Solana libraries, not deprecated functions

**WHY AI DID WORSE (ON SOME):**

Complex, novel patterns that weren't in training data.

Example: "Quadratic voting with 6-month cliff vesting"

AI confidently generated something that looked right but had subtle logic errors.

**THE SOLUTION:**

Hybrid approach:
- AI handles patterns (95% of projects use standard features)
- Humans review edge cases and novel logic
- Automated scanning catches known vulnerabilities
- Manual review for high-risk features

This is what OPTIK does.

**WHAT THIS MEANS:**

Your local dev agency charging $50K for a token contract?

They're probably:
- Using boilerplate (same as everyone else)
- Making human errors (fatigue, copy-paste, rushing)
- Using outdated patterns (haven't retrained on latest Solana updates)

AI can do that work:
- Faster (5 min vs 6 weeks)
- Cheaper ($149 vs $50K)
- More securely (0.9 vs 4.7 vulnerabilities)

**THE LAUNCH:**

OPTIK is live: optik.build

$149-$599 depending on complexity. Security-audited. Full code ownership.

$5K bug bounty if you find critical vulnerabilities in our output.

**THE DEBATE:**

I know this is controversial. "AI replacing devs" triggers people.

But genuinely: What am I missing?

Where is human development ACTUALLY better than AI for commodity code?

(Not talking about novel DeFi primitives. Talking about standard tokens/staking/governance.)

Drop counterarguments below. Want to make sure I'm not in an echo chamber.

# PHASE 3: POST-LAUNCH CONTENT STRATEGY (Week 1-4)

## Week 1: Social Proof + Case Studies

### Twitter Thread: "5 Projects Built with OPTIK in First 24 Hours"

**Hook:** "5 projects went from idea → mainnet using OPTIK in the first 24 hours. Here's what they built (and what this means for Solana):"

**Body:**
```
1/ 5 projects went from idea → mainnet using OPTIK in the first 24 hours.

Zero to deployed in under 10 minutes each.

Here's what they built: 🧵

2/ PROJECT 1: $FIT - Fitness Token with Streak Rewards

Creator: Personal trainer, zero coding experience

Features:
- Token-gated workout content
- Streak tracking (workout consistency earns rewards)
- Tiered access (Bronze/Silver/Gold holders)
- Automated weekly airdrops

Tier used: Professional ($279)
Generation time: 5 min 42 sec
Currently: 120 holders, $8K TVL

3/ PROJECT 2: $VINYL - Music Collective Governance Token

Creator: Independent record label

Features:
- Quadratic voting for artist signings
- Revenue sharing (sales → token holder distribution)
- Proposal system for marketing spend
- 6-month artist vesting

Tier used: Enterprise ($599)
Generation time: 11 min 04 sec
Currently: DAO vote happening TODAY on first artist signing

4/ PROJECT 3: $BREW - Coffee Shop Loyalty Token

Creator: Café owner (yes, real main street business)

Features:
- 1 $BREW = $1 discount (redeemable in-store)
- QR code redemption at POS
- Monthly burn of unclaimed tokens
- Referral rewards (bring a friend → earn tokens)

Tier used: Professional ($279)
Generation time: 6 min 18 sec
Currently: 47 customers onboarded, averaging 3.2 redemptions/week

This is ACTUAL crypto main street adoption.

5/ PROJECT 4: $PARTY - Event Planning DAO

Creator: Event organizer collective

Features:
- Governance token for venue/artist selection
- Ticket sales → treasury
- Attendee rewards (show up → earn tokens)
- Future event voting rights

Tier used: Enterprise ($599)
Generation time: 9 min 33 sec
Currently: Planning first event (500+ interested)

6/ PROJECT 5: $LEARN - EdTech Microcredentials

Creator: Online course creator

Features:
- NFT credentials (course completion → token + NFT)
- Student holder benefits (discounts, early access)
- Instructor revenue share
- Skill-tree unlocking (gamified learning paths)

Tier used: Professional ($279)
Generation time: 7 min 11 sec
Currently: 200+ students enrolled

7/ THE PATTERN:

None of these are meme coins.
None are "get rich quick" schemes.
All are real businesses using tokens as infrastructure.

This is what Solana was BUILT for:
- Fast transactions (loyalty redemptions need speed)
- Low fees (microtransactions for learning)
- Scalable (mainstream adoption requires capacity)

8/ WHAT THEY ALL SAID:

"I thought I needed a CTO. Turns out I just needed OPTIK."

"The security audit alone would've cost more than the generation."

"I can iterate on tokenomics in minutes instead of waiting weeks for dev revisions."

9/ THE IMPLICATIONS:

Right now there are 10K+ founders with ideas locked in their heads because they "aren't technical."

Every one could be:
- TVL contributor
- Community builder
- Ecosystem growth driver

OPTIK removes that barrier.

10/ WEEK 1 STATS:

- 89 total generations
- 47 deployed to mainnet
- 0 critical security issues
- Avg generation time: 5 min 32 sec
- Avg satisfaction: 9.1/10

This is just week one. 🚀

11/ TRY IT:

optik.build

Waitlist discount (20% off) ends Sunday.
After that, back to full price.

If you have an idea, now's the time to build.
